==============================
Airy Web Application Framework
==============================

Airy is a new Web application development framework.

Contrast to most currently available frameworks, Airy
doesn't use the standard notion of HTTP requests and pages.

Instead, it makes use of WebSockets (via Socket.io) and
provides a set of tools to let you focus on the interface,
not content delivery.

Currently Airy supports MongoDB only. We will support other
NoSQL databases, but we have no plans for supporting SQL.


Requirements
============

Airy will install most required modules itself when you create a new
project, so all you need is:

* Python 2.6+
* MongoDB


Installation
============

    pip install airy

This will install Airy itself and the ``airy-admin.py`` script.


Usage
=====

Once you have it installed, you should be able to use ``airy-admin.py``

To create a new project, open a terminal and do::

    airy-admin.py startproject project_name
    cd project_name/
    python manage.py update_ve
    python manage.py runserver

You should have it running locally on port 8000. Open your browser
and navigate to http://localhost:8000

Note: if it complains about a "Connection Error" it means you have
no MongoDB running, or it's dead.

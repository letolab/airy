Quick Tutorial
====================================

Airy is a new Web application development framework.

Contrast to most currently available frameworks, Airy doesn't use the standard notion of HTTP requests and pages.

Instead, it makes use of WebSockets (via Socket.io) and provides a set of tools to let you focus on the interface, not content delivery.

Currently Airy supports MongoDB only. We will support other NoSQL databases, but we have no plans for supporting SQL.
